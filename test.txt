Willkommen zum Spell Checking in Brackets. Keine Ahnung, ob dass jetzt funktioniert.

Avant j'utilisais un script, avec ce panneau c'est plus simple. N'oubliez pas de régler à 240ppp la résolution dans Camera Raw (Options de flux de production), sinon la taille du calque est modifiée.

The Spelling Chequer (or poet tree without mist takes)

Eye have a spelling chequer

It came with my pea sea

It plainly marks four my revue

Miss steaks eye cannot see

Each thyme when I have struct the quays

Eye weight four it two say

If watt eye rote is wrong or rite

It shows me strait a weigh

As soon as a mist ache is maid

It nose bee fore too late

And eye can put the error rite

Eye really fined it grate

I’ve run this poem threw it

I’m sure your policed to no

It’s letter perfect in its weigh

My chequer tolled me sew
